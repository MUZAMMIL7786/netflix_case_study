Netflix is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of movies and TV shows. It has been very successful in recent years, but it is facing some challenges.

Netflix has faced a number of business problems in recent years. These include:

- Slowing subscriber growth: Netflix's subscriber growth has been slowing in recent quarters. In the first quarter of 2022, the company added only 200,000 subscribers, which was the slowest quarterly growth in the company's history.
- Increased churn: Netflix's churn rate, which is the percentage of subscribers who cancel their subscriptions each month, has also been increasing. In the first quarter of 2022, Netflix's churn rate was 13%, which was the highest churn rate in the company's history.
- Pricing pressure: Netflix is facing pricing pressure from both competitors and regulators. Competitors are offering lower-priced plans, and regulators are cracking down on streaming services that charge excessive prices.
- Content costs: The cost of content is rising, which is putting pressure on Netflix's margins. Netflix is spending more money on content to compete with other streaming services, but this is not translating into increased revenue.

## Insights: The insights that I derived from my analysis of the Netflix business problem are as follows:
1. Rajiv Chilaka, Jan Suter are considered as best directors according to more number of Movie releases i.e 22, 21 respectively. So these directors movies could help in grow bussiness for 29 netflix.
2. Alastair Fothergill, Ken Burns are considered as best directors according to more number of TV Show releases i.e 3, 3 respectively. So these directors TV Shows are benificial to the Netflix bussiness
3. International Movies (2752), Dramas (2427), Comedies (1674), are mostly viewed genre in Netflix, So movies with these genre has more demand
4. Anupam Kher (42), Shah Rukh Khan (35), Naseeruddin Shah(32) are the best actors according to most number of movie releases and has good fan base, So these actors movies could help grow bussiness
5. Takahiro Sakurai (25), Yuki Kaji (19), Daisuke Ono (17) are the best actors according to most number of TV SHow releases, So these actors TV Show help build bussiness.
6. United States (3690), India (1046), United Kingdom (806) these countries have the highest releases. So their is no risk of amount burn either in marketing or sales coz its already done.
7. Due to pandamic occured in 2019-2022 their is a fall in movie productions.

## Recommendations: Based on my insights, I recommend that netflix focus on the following areas:
- The streaming industry is becoming increasingly competitive, and Netflix will need to continue to innovate in order to stay ahead of the competition.
- Customers are becoming more demanding, and Netflix will need to meet these demands in order to retain subscribers.
- The cost of content is rising, and Netflix will need to find ways to control its costs in order to maintain its profitability.
